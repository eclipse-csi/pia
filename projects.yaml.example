# PIA Projects File Example
#
# This file shows an example projects file for both GitHub Actions and Jenkins projects.
# Copy this to projects.yaml and customize for your projects.

projects:
  # Example GitHub Actions project
  my-github-project:
    issuer: "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
    dt_parent_uuid: "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc"
    required_claims:
      repository: "eclipse-foo/my-github-project"

  # Example Jenkins project
  my-jenkins-project:
    issuer: "https://ci.eclipse.org/my-jenkins-project/oidc"
    dt_parent_uuid: "87654321-4321-4321-4321-cba987654321"
    # Note: Jenkins projects typically don't need required_claims
    # because the issuer URL itself identifies the project
